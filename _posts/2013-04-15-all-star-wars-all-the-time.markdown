For those of you who have just come back from Antarctica and haven't seen the 6 Panel Star Wars yet, go take a look!

It's almost worth having to sit through Jar Jar as you can just ignore that panel every time he comes on.

Also, before any die hard fans point it out, we are aware that [Aqualish](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Aqualish) only have 2 or 4 eyes, not 6, but 6 just fits the theme better.
