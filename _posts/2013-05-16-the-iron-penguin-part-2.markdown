This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


Linus has dived in to save the day. Where did the robot come from? What is its purpose? Can the Iron Penguin stand against it?

Find out next time. Same penguin-time, same penguin-channel.

P.S. I wasn't too keen on inserting Google glass into another comic so close on the heels of the last one, but it made the most sense to slip it in to replace Jarvis from the Iron Man movies.

Also, credit where it is due:

The basic idea for the suit came from a photoshop entry on [freakingnews.com](http://www.freakingnews.com/Iron-Man-Penguin-Pics-91163.asp).

I freely admit to having shamelessly cherry picked quotes from IM1 and 2 and mashed them together. Just thought I would throw those out there before someone tries to troll me about it. :)
