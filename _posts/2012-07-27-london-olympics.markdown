Maybe I am being a bit rough on good old London, but there is some pretty crazy stuff going on, like:

>Surface-to-Air missiles being mounted on apartment buildings (just in case you want to shoot down a plane in the middle of a city)
>
>The biggest military buildup in London since World War II (twice as many UK soldiers than in Afghanistan at it's peak)
>
>One CCTV camera for every 14 people (now with heat tracking! It's like having the Predator sitting on the corner of every block)
>
>11 mile long, 6 meter high, 5,000-volt electric fence in the middle of the city. (more than two meters taller than that one they tore down in Berlin)
>
>The wettest April to June on record

That doesn't sound very inviting to me...
