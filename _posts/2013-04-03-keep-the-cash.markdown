Apparently Microsoft has decided to [expand it's pay for apps program](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57575215-75/microsoft-offers-developers-$100-per-windows-8-app/) to cover just about anything. Up until now they were a bit more selective about providing support only to more popular apps.

I can't help but wonder about the quality of the apps this will produce. $100 per app isn't enough to motivate someone to make a major time and effort investment into writing a serious app when they otherwise wouldn't have, so I can't see it doing much more than rewarding people who were already going to write their app anyway (not necessarily a bad thing, but that doesn't achieve the intended goal) or motivate people to spam out quick and useless apps where their effort < $100 worth so that they profit.

Does anyone remember that "[I am rich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)" app that was briefly on the Apple store? Well there is at least one of them on the Windows 8 store apparently, and I suspect we will see a whole lot more similarly useless apps...
