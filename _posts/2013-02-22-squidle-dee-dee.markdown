This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


There has been quite a lot of coverage about the [first ever footage of a giant squid](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2013/01/24/giant-squid-discovery/1861451/) in the wild. But this begs the question : How will the squid make the best use of it's 5 seconds of fame?
