This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


I wish I could take credit for this week's comic idea, but it was inspired by a comment on the original article I was reading (which I can't find now unfortunately).
