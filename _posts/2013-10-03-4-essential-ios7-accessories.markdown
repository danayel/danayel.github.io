This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


When I first wrote the ideas down for this comic, I hadn't heard of anyone actually suffering from motion sickness, but it seems that it didn't take long at all before the [reports started to roll in](http://www.zdnet.com/apples-ios-7-makes-users-sick-7000021259/).

I upgraded my old iPhone 4, and very quickly found myself squinting when I used it. I had to resort in the end to using my computer glasses (with blue light cutout) so I could use it with a semblance of comfort.

On the bright side (pun not intended), at least they won't have to be concerned with anyone trying to copy iOS anymore.
