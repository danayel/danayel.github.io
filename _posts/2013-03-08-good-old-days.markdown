This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


As pointed out by [Katherine Noyes](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2029372/where-things-stand-with-sailfish-os-and-tizen.html), most of the talk coming out of the WMC is about the new up and coming Linux based modile OSes rather than the usual Android/iPhone focus. It's great to see some more competition entering the field, and especially good for Linux that pretty much every one of the newer systems is Linux based.

Linux is certainly forging ahead in the mobile space.
