I have heard a lot of good things about the Moto X, [both online](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/technology/personaltech/the-moto-x-from-google-iphones-latest-challenger.html?_r=0) and from friends, and I am seriously considering getting one as my next phone. I am still not entirely sure if I am onboard with the whole voice control thing though.

I do admit though that the "always on" feature of the Moto X voice control is a little interesting. The only time I personally could imagine using voice control is when I am working in the garden or shed and want to do something on my phone without having to wash my hands first. This situation defeats the purpose of other voice control systems such as siri on the iPhone which requires you to press a button - with said dirty hands - before you can issue the handless commands.

I know the stereotype situation for voice control is while driving, but I can't see how it would be any less distracting trying to voice control your phone while on the road than it would be texting or playing Angry Birds.

The downside to always on though is that it is always on and therefore it is possible to pick up commands that weren't actually commands...
