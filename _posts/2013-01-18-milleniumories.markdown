This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


I read an [interesting article](http://www.zdnet.com/the-1000-year-dvd-is-here-7000009771/) the other day about DVDs that apparently can last up to a thousand years. Granted, the article itself wasn't particularly interesting, but the possibility of leaving something behind that can actually last for such a period of time is interesting. Very few books, unless in hermetically sealed containers, and even some stone tablets would struggle to make it to the 1000 year mark.

However, the downside to this is the temptation that we all suffer when provided with more storage space : Let's store EVERYTHING. I wonder what future humans will think of us if they open up a time capsule and find tween music, tax returns, and cute photos of cats.

At least they might appreciate the cats.
