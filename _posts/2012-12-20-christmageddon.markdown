If you are looking at this strip, then the world didn't come to an end after all.

It would seem that the Mayan calendar coming to an end really signified the same thing as the end to one of our calendar's signifies : time to get a new calendar.

Merry Christmas / Happy Holidays / Happy Hanukkah / Happy couple of days off work for a holiday you have no vested interest in  (take your pick) from the Linux.com team.
