Disney bought Lucasfilm.

Say it slowly so it sinks in.

Disney. Bought. Lucasfilm.

You know, the guys that make movies like Aladdin and the Mermaid Princess, now own the Start Wars ip.

There has been quite a lot of speculation of whether this will save or destroy Star Wars, and also what it will mean for the gaming arm of the company - Lucas Arts.

Allegedly, the first thing Disney did was announce that they would release Episode VII. I just hope they don't use the same writers as their other movies.
