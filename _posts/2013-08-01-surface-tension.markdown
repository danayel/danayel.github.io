This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


This is just a rumor, but apparently there are [6 million](http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/07/19/0122223/microsoft-is-sitting-on-six-million-unsold-surface-tablets) (give or take) unsold MS surfaces. This has been deduced from [their mobile division write off](http://www.smartcompany.com.au/information-technology/056615-microsoft-swallows-bitter-tablet-as-share-price-dives.html).

Given their seeming failure as a mobile platform, we would like to suggest some alternative uses, that may provide for more sales of the surface hardware. Note that the first one - skateboards - had already been offered up as a prophetic suggestion by [MS themselves](https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+surface+skateboard).
