This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


The first installment of The Iron Penguin!

Why is the Robot rampaging through Tokyo? (Actually, why does just about every giant robot and monster rampage through Tokyo, or live deep in the ocean just off the coast?)

Who will save the day?

These questions and possibly more will be answered soon...

I hope to see some of you at LinuxCon Japan and the Automotive Linux Summit this year.
