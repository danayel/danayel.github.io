This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


If you ever had any doubt about [those statistics](http://www.zdnet.com/ipad-suffers-dramatic-post-christmas-web-share-fall-report-7000009332/?s_cid=e539) and exactly what those people were doing with their new surfaces on Christmas day....

I can't take the credit for the idea though, I shamelessly snagged it from a comment on the article.

Happy new year and welcome to 2013 by the way!
