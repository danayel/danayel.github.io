This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


For those scarce few that haven't heard, the WCIT is going on in Dubai right now with a proposal to fundamentally alter the nature of the internet and essentially bring it under the thumb of governments and telecommunications companies, but there is also a grab bag of concessions to other industries, notably media, in the form of Intellectual Property proposals.

Very little has been made public by the ITU about the proposals and we are ultimately reliant on leaks and friendly government bodies to [let the public know](http://wcitleaks.org/) what is going on.  Which is scary considering how important the internet is to pretty much the entire world these days.
