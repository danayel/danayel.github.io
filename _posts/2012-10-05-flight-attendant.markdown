This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


If anyone was wondering why those [two flight attendants from united had a fight](http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2012/09/flight-attendant-spat-delays-flight-again/70001208/1), we have it from a good source that they were simply vigorously discussing which desktop Linux OS they think is best.
