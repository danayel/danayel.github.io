This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


In what seems more like some kind of bad spy comedy than real life, John McAfee (yes that virus guy) had allegedly managed to avoid getting questioned by police in Belize by donning a series of [truly crazy disguises](http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mcafee-disguise-2012-11).

His luck appeared to have run out when he was arrested for trying to jump the border into Guatemala, and while some people may have liked to have seen the final panel come to fruition, he applied for asylum in Guatamala, but was refused. He then managed to [fake a heart attack](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/13/justice/florida-john-mcafee/index.html) to buy enough time for his lawyer to prevent his deportation to Belize and he instead wiggled in a [deportation to the US](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/12/12/goodbye-guatemala-john-mcafee-to-return-to-us/) as a consolation prize.

Given the end result, it is difficult to decide if he is just really lucky or if he is really that good that he really did pull it off as planned.
