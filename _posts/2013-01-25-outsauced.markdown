I am sure pretty much everyone has heard by now of the developer who [outsourced his job to China](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/17/developer-outsources-job-to-china-so-he-can-watch-cat-videos/).

I am equally sure that all of us are jealous, and as far as I can tell, the only criticism seems to be that he was silly enough to get caught. Which makes me wonder how many people out there are already doing this, or now planning to do this in such as way as they don't get caught.
