This comic originally appeared on [linux.com](https://www.linux.com) and was sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).


I know this is [kind of old news](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57565862-71/bill-gates-my-kids-have-never-asked-for-apple-products/), but I came across the article again the other day and I got to wondering about what the truth behind the rumor was.
