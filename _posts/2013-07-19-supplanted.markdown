It's kind of old news, but still interesting. Apparently plants do some [pretty complex mathematical projections](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22991838) to work out how best to regulate their starch reserves overnight.

We already know that plants talk to each other via fungus and chemical emissions. Now they can do math too.

We were all afraid of being replaced by robots, but what if the future has plants taking over the (modern) world.

They may already be plotting it via their little fungal-chemical secret intranet....
